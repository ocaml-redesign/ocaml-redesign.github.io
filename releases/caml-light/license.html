                            Preamble

  The licenses <span class='k'>for</span> most software are designed <span class='k'>to</span> take away your
freedom <span class='k'>to</span> share <span class='k'>and</span> change it<span class='o'>.</span>  By contrast<span class='o'>,</span> the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended <span class='k'>to</span> guarantee your freedom <span class='k'>to</span> share <span class='k'>and</span> change
free software<span class='o'>--</span><span class='k'>to</span> make sure the software is free <span class='k'>for</span> all its users<span class='o'>.</span>

  This license<span class='o'>,</span> the Library General Public License<span class='o'>,</span> applies <span class='k'>to</span> some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> <span class='k'>to</span> any
other libraries whose authors decide <span class='k'>to</span> use it<span class='o'>.</span>  You can use it <span class='k'>for</span>
your libraries<span class='o'>,</span> too<span class='o'>.</span>

  When we speak <span class='k'>of</span> free software<span class='o'>,</span> we are referring <span class='k'>to</span> freedom<span class='o'>,</span> not
price<span class='o'>.</span>  Our General Public Licenses are designed <span class='k'>to</span> make sure that you
have the freedom <span class='k'>to</span> distribute copies <span class='k'>of</span> free software (<span class='k'>and</span> charge <span class='k'>for</span>
this service <span class='k'>if</span> you wish)<span class='o'>,</span> that you receive source code <span class='k'>or</span> can get it
<span class='k'>if</span> you want it<span class='o'>,</span> that you can change the software <span class='k'>or</span> use pieces <span class='k'>of</span> it
<span class='k'>in</span> <span class='k'>new</span> free programs<span class='o'>;</span> <span class='k'>and</span> that you know you can <span class='k'>do</span> these things<span class='o'>.</span>

  To protect your rights<span class='o'>,</span> we need <span class='k'>to</span> make restrictions that forbid
anyone <span class='k'>to</span> deny you these rights <span class='k'>or</span> <span class='k'>to</span> ask you <span class='k'>to</span> surrender the rights<span class='o'>.</span>
These restrictions translate <span class='k'>to</span> certain responsibilities <span class='k'>for</span> you <span class='k'>if</span>
you distribute copies <span class='k'>of</span> the library<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>or</span> <span class='k'>if</span> you modify it<span class='o'>.</span>

  For example<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>if</span> you distribute copies <span class='k'>of</span> the library<span class='o'>,</span> whether gratis
<span class='k'>or</span> <span class='k'>for</span> a fee<span class='o'>,</span> you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you<span class='o'>.</span>  You must make sure that they<span class='o'>,</span> too<span class='o'>,</span> receive <span class='k'>or</span> can get the source
code<span class='o'>.</span>  If you link a program <span class='k'>with</span> the library<span class='o'>,</span> you must provide
complete object files <span class='k'>to</span> the recipients so that they can relink them
<span class='k'>with</span> the library<span class='o'>,</span> after making changes <span class='k'>to</span> the library and rec<span class='o'>ompiling</span>
it<span class='o'>.</span>  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights<span class='o'>.</span>

  Our <span class='k'>method</span> <span class='k'>of</span> protecting your rights has two steps<span class='o'>:</span> (1) copyright
the library<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission <span class='k'>to</span> copy<span class='o'>,</span> distribute <span class='k'>and</span><span class='o'>/</span><span class='k'>or</span> modify the library<span class='o'>.</span>

  Also<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>for</span> each distributor's protection<span class='o'>,</span> we want <span class='k'>to</span> make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty <span class='k'>for</span> this free
library<span class='o'>.</span>  If the library is modified by someone <span class='k'>else</span> <span class='k'>and</span> passed on<span class='o'>,</span> we
want its recipients <span class='k'>to</span> know that what they have is not the original
version<span class='o'>,</span> so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations<span class='o'>.</span>

  Finally<span class='o'>,</span> any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents<span class='o'>.</span>  We wish <span class='k'>to</span> avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses<span class='o'>,</span> thus <span class='k'>in</span> effect
transforming the program into proprietary software<span class='o'>.</span>  To prevent this<span class='o'>,</span>
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed <span class='k'>for</span> everyone's
free use <span class='k'>or</span> not licensed at all<span class='o'>.</span>

  Most GNU software<span class='o'>,</span> including some libraries<span class='o'>,</span> is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License<span class='o'>,</span> which was designed <span class='k'>for</span> utility programs<span class='o'>.</span>  This
license<span class='o'>,</span> the GNU Library General Public License<span class='o'>,</span> applies <span class='k'>to</span> certain
designated libraries<span class='o'>.</span>  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one<span class='o'>;</span> be sure <span class='k'>to</span> read it <span class='k'>in</span> full<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> don't assume that anything <span class='k'>in</span> it is
the same <span class='k'>as</span> <span class='k'>in</span> the ordinary license<span class='o'>.</span>

  The reason we have a separate public license <span class='k'>for</span> some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying <span class='k'>or</span> adding <span class='k'>to</span> a
program <span class='k'>and</span> simply using it<span class='o'>.</span>  Linking a program <span class='k'>with</span> a library<span class='o'>,</span> without
changing the library<span class='o'>,</span> is <span class='k'>in</span> some sense simply using the library<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> is
analogous <span class='k'>to</span> running a utility program <span class='k'>or</span> application program<span class='o'>.</span>  However<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>in</span>
a textual <span class='k'>and</span> legal sense<span class='o'>,</span> the linked executable is a combined work<span class='o'>,</span> a
derivative <span class='k'>of</span> the original library<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> the ordinary General Public License
treats it <span class='k'>as</span> such<span class='o'>.</span>

  Because <span class='k'>of</span> this blurred distinction<span class='o'>,</span> using the ordinary General
Public License <span class='k'>for</span> libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing<span class='o'>,</span> because most developers did not use the libraries<span class='o'>.</span>  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better<span class='o'>.</span>

  However<span class='o'>,</span> unrestricted linking <span class='k'>of</span> non<span class='o'>-</span>free programs would deprive the
users <span class='k'>of</span> those programs <span class='k'>of</span> all benefit from the free status <span class='k'>of</span> the
libraries themselves<span class='o'>.</span>  This Library General Public License is intended <span class='k'>to</span>
permit developers <span class='k'>of</span> non<span class='o'>-</span>free programs <span class='k'>to</span> use free libraries<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>while</span>
preserving your freedom <span class='k'>as</span> a user <span class='k'>of</span> such programs <span class='k'>to</span> change the free
libraries that are incorporated <span class='k'>in</span> them<span class='o'>.</span>  (We have not seen how <span class='k'>to</span> achieve
this <span class='k'>as</span> regards changes <span class='k'>in</span> header files<span class='o'>,</span> but we have achieved it <span class='k'>as</span> regards
changes <span class='k'>in</span> the actual functions <span class='k'>of</span> the <span class='m'>Library</span><span class='o'>.</span>)  The hope is that this
will lead <span class='k'>to</span> faster development <span class='k'>of</span> free libraries<span class='o'>.</span>

  The precise terms <span class='k'>and</span> conditions <span class='k'>for</span> copying<span class='o'>,</span> distribution <span class='k'>and</span>
modification follow<span class='o'>.</span>  Pay close attention <span class='k'>to</span> the difference between a
<span class='s'>&#34;work based on the library&#34;</span> <span class='k'>and</span> a <span class='s'>&#34;work that uses the library&#34;</span><span class='o'>.</span>  The
former contains code derived from the library<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>while</span> the latter only
works together <span class='k'>with</span> the library<span class='o'>.</span>

  Note that it is possible <span class='k'>for</span> a library <span class='k'>to</span> be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one<span class='o'>.</span>

                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING<span class='o'>,</span> DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies <span class='k'>to</span> any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder <span class='k'>or</span> other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms <span class='k'>of</span> this Library
General Public License (also called <span class='s'>&#34;this License&#34;</span>)<span class='o'>.</span>  Each licensee is
addressed <span class='k'>as</span> <span class='s'>&#34;you&#34;</span><span class='o'>.</span>

  A <span class='s'>&#34;library&#34;</span> means a collection <span class='k'>of</span> software functions <span class='k'>and</span><span class='o'>/</span><span class='k'>or</span> data
prepared so <span class='k'>as</span> <span class='k'>to</span> be conveniently linked <span class='k'>with</span> application programs
(which use some <span class='k'>of</span> those functions <span class='k'>and</span> data) <span class='k'>to</span> form executables<span class='o'>.</span>

  The <span class='s'>&#34;Library&#34;</span><span class='o'>,</span> below<span class='o'>,</span> refers <span class='k'>to</span> any such software library <span class='k'>or</span> work
which has been distributed under these terms<span class='o'>.</span>  A <span class='s'>&#34;work based on the
Library&#34;</span> means either the Library <span class='k'>or</span> any derivative work under
copyright law<span class='o'>:</span> that is <span class='k'>to</span> say<span class='o'>,</span> a work containing the Library <span class='k'>or</span> a
portion <span class='k'>of</span> it<span class='o'>,</span> either verbatim <span class='k'>or</span> <span class='k'>with</span> modifications <span class='k'>and</span><span class='o'>/</span><span class='k'>or</span> translated
straightforwardly into another language<span class='o'>.</span>  (Hereinafter<span class='o'>,</span> translation is
included without limitation <span class='k'>in</span> the term <span class='s'>&#34;modification&#34;</span><span class='o'>.)</span>

  <span class='s'>&#34;Source code&#34;</span> <span class='k'>for</span> a work means the preferred form <span class='k'>of</span> the work <span class='k'>for</span>
making modifications <span class='k'>to</span> it<span class='o'>.</span>  For a library<span class='o'>,</span> complete source code means
all the source code <span class='k'>for</span> all modules it contains<span class='o'>,</span> plus any associated
interface definition files<span class='o'>,</span> plus the scripts used <span class='k'>to</span> control compilation
<span class='k'>and</span> installation <span class='k'>of</span> the library<span class='o'>.</span>

  Activities other than copying<span class='o'>,</span> distribution <span class='k'>and</span> modification are not
covered by this License<span class='o'>;</span> they are outside its scope<span class='o'>.</span>  The act <span class='k'>of</span>
running a program using the Library is not restricted<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> output from
such a program is covered only <span class='k'>if</span> its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent <span class='k'>of</span> the use <span class='k'>of</span> the Library <span class='k'>in</span> a tool <span class='k'>for</span>
writing it)<span class='o'>.</span>  Whether that is <span class='o'>true</span> depends on what the Library does
<span class='k'>and</span> what the program that uses the Library does<span class='o'>.</span>

  1. You may copy <span class='k'>and</span> distribute verbatim copies <span class='k'>of</span> the Library's
complete source code <span class='k'>as</span> you receive it<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>in</span> any medium<span class='o'>,</span> provided that
you conspicuously <span class='k'>and</span> appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice <span class='k'>and</span> disclaimer <span class='k'>of</span> warranty<span class='o'>;</span> keep intact
all the notices that refer <span class='k'>to</span> this License <span class='k'>and</span> <span class='k'>to</span> the absence <span class='k'>of</span> any
warranty<span class='o'>;</span> <span class='k'>and</span> distribute a copy <span class='k'>of</span> this License along <span class='k'>with</span> the
<span class='m'>Library</span><span class='o'>.</span>

  You may charge a fee <span class='k'>for</span> the physical act <span class='k'>of</span> transferring a copy<span class='o'>,</span>
<span class='k'>and</span> you may at your option offer warranty protection <span class='k'>in</span> exchange <span class='k'>for</span> a
fee<span class='o'>.</span>

  2. You may modify your copy <span class='k'>or</span> copies <span class='k'>of</span> the Library <span class='k'>or</span> any portion
<span class='k'>of</span> it<span class='o'>,</span> thus forming a work based on the Library<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> copy <span class='k'>and</span>
distribute such modifications <span class='k'>or</span> work under the terms <span class='k'>of</span> Section 1
above<span class='o'>,</span> provided that you also meet all <span class='k'>of</span> these conditions<span class='o'>:</span>

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library<span class='o'>.</span>

    b) You must cause the files modified <span class='k'>to</span> carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files <span class='k'>and</span> the date <span class='k'>of</span> any change<span class='o'>.</span>

    c) You must cause the whole <span class='k'>of</span> the work <span class='k'>to</span> be licensed at no
    charge <span class='k'>to</span> all third parties under the terms <span class='k'>of</span> this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>

    d) If a facility <span class='k'>in</span> the modified Library refers <span class='k'>to</span> a <span class='k'>function</span> <span class='k'>or</span> a
    table <span class='k'>of</span> data <span class='k'>to</span> be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility<span class='o'>,</span> other than <span class='k'>as</span> an argument passed <span class='k'>when</span> the facility
    is invoked<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>then</span> you must make a good faith effort <span class='k'>to</span> ensure that<span class='o'>,</span>
    <span class='k'>in</span> the event an application does not supply such <span class='k'>function</span> <span class='k'>or</span>
    table<span class='o'>,</span> the facility still operates<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> performs whatever part <span class='k'>of</span>
    its purpose remains meaningful<span class='o'>.</span>

    (For example<span class='o'>,</span> a <span class='k'>function</span> <span class='k'>in</span> a library <span class='k'>to</span> compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well<span class='o'>-</span>defined independent <span class='k'>of</span> the
    application<span class='o'>.</span>  Therefore<span class='o'>,</span> Subsection 2d requires that any
    application<span class='o'>-</span>supplied <span class='k'>function</span> <span class='k'>or</span> table used by this <span class='k'>function</span> must
    be optional<span class='o'>:</span> <span class='k'>if</span> the application does not supply it<span class='o'>,</span> the square
    root <span class='k'>function</span> must still compute square roots<span class='o'>.)</span>

These requirements apply <span class='k'>to</span> the modified work <span class='k'>as</span> a whole<span class='o'>.</span>  If
identifiable sections <span class='k'>of</span> that work are not derived from the Library<span class='o'>,</span>
<span class='k'>and</span> can be reasonably considered independent <span class='k'>and</span> separate works <span class='k'>in</span>
themselves<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>then</span> this License<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> its terms<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>do</span> not apply <span class='k'>to</span> those
sections <span class='k'>when</span> you distribute them <span class='k'>as</span> separate works<span class='o'>.</span>  But <span class='k'>when</span> you
distribute the same sections <span class='k'>as</span> part <span class='k'>of</span> a whole which is a work based
on the Library<span class='o'>,</span> the distribution <span class='k'>of</span> the whole must be on the terms <span class='k'>of</span>
this License<span class='o'>,</span> whose permissions <span class='k'>for</span> other licensees extend <span class='k'>to</span> the
entire whole<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> thus <span class='k'>to</span> each <span class='k'>and</span> every part regardless <span class='k'>of</span> who wrote
it<span class='o'>.</span>

Thus<span class='o'>,</span> it is not the intent <span class='k'>of</span> this section <span class='k'>to</span> claim rights <span class='k'>or</span> contest
your rights <span class='k'>to</span> work written entirely by you<span class='o'>;</span> rather<span class='o'>,</span> the intent is <span class='k'>to</span>
exercise the right <span class='k'>to</span> control the distribution <span class='k'>of</span> derivative <span class='k'>or</span>
collective works based on the <span class='m'>Library</span><span class='o'>.</span>

In addition<span class='o'>,</span> mere aggregation <span class='k'>of</span> another work not based on the Library
<span class='k'>with</span> the Library (<span class='k'>or</span> <span class='k'>with</span> a work based on the Library) on a volume <span class='k'>of</span>
a storage <span class='k'>or</span> distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope <span class='k'>of</span> this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>

  3. You may opt <span class='k'>to</span> apply the terms <span class='k'>of</span> the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead <span class='k'>of</span> this License <span class='k'>to</span> a given copy <span class='k'>of</span> the <span class='m'>Library</span><span class='o'>.</span>  To <span class='k'>do</span>
this<span class='o'>,</span> you must alter all the notices that refer <span class='k'>to</span> this License<span class='o'>,</span> so
that they refer <span class='k'>to</span> the ordinary GNU General Public License<span class='o'>,</span> version 2<span class='o'>,</span>
instead <span class='k'>of</span> <span class='k'>to</span> this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>  (If a newer version than version 2 <span class='k'>of</span> the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>then</span> you can specify
that version instead <span class='k'>if</span> you wish<span class='o'>.)</span>  Do not make any other change <span class='k'>in</span>
these notices<span class='o'>.</span>

  Once this change is made <span class='k'>in</span> a given copy<span class='o'>,</span> it is irreversible <span class='k'>for</span>
that copy<span class='o'>,</span> so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies <span class='k'>to</span> all
subsequent copies <span class='k'>and</span> derivative works made from that copy<span class='o'>.</span>

  This option is useful <span class='k'>when</span> you wish <span class='k'>to</span> copy part <span class='k'>of</span> the code <span class='k'>of</span>
the Library into a program that is not a library<span class='o'>.</span>

  4. You may copy <span class='k'>and</span> distribute the Library (<span class='k'>or</span> a portion <span class='k'>or</span>
derivative <span class='k'>of</span> it<span class='o'>,</span> under Section 2) <span class='k'>in</span> object code <span class='k'>or</span> executable form
under the terms <span class='k'>of</span> Sections 1 <span class='k'>and</span> 2 above provided that you accompany
it <span class='k'>with</span> the complete corresponding machine<span class='o'>-</span>readable source code<span class='o'>,</span> which
must be distributed under the terms <span class='k'>of</span> Sections 1 <span class='k'>and</span> 2 above on a
medium customarily used <span class='k'>for</span> software interchange<span class='o'>.</span>

  If distribution <span class='k'>of</span> object code is made by offering access <span class='k'>to</span> copy
from a designated place<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>then</span> offering equivalent access <span class='k'>to</span> copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement <span class='k'>to</span>
distribute the source code<span class='o'>,</span> even though third parties are not
compelled <span class='k'>to</span> copy the source along <span class='k'>with</span> the object code<span class='o'>.</span>

  5. A program that contains no derivative <span class='k'>of</span> any portion <span class='k'>of</span> the
Library<span class='o'>,</span> but is designed <span class='k'>to</span> work <span class='k'>with</span> the Library by being compiled <span class='k'>or</span>
linked <span class='k'>with</span> it<span class='o'>,</span> is called a <span class='s'>&#34;work that uses the Library&#34;</span><span class='o'>.</span>  Such a
work<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>in</span> isolation<span class='o'>,</span> is not a derivative work <span class='k'>of</span> the Library<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span>
therefore falls outside the scope <span class='k'>of</span> this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>

  However<span class='o'>,</span> linking a <span class='s'>&#34;work that uses the Library&#34;</span> <span class='k'>with</span> the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative <span class='k'>of</span> the Library (because it
contains portions <span class='k'>of</span> the Library)<span class='o'>,</span> rather than a <span class='s'>&#34;work that uses the
library&#34;</span><span class='o'>.</span>  The executable is therefore covered by this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>
Section 6 states terms <span class='k'>for</span> distribution <span class='k'>of</span> such executables<span class='o'>.</span>

  When a <span class='s'>&#34;work that uses the Library&#34;</span> uses material from a header file
that is part <span class='k'>of</span> the Library<span class='o'>,</span> the object code <span class='k'>for</span> the work may be a
derivative work <span class='k'>of</span> the Library even though the source code is not<span class='o'>.</span>
Whether this is <span class='o'>true</span> is especially significant <span class='k'>if</span> the work can be
linked without the Library<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>or</span> <span class='k'>if</span> the work is itself a library<span class='o'>.</span>  The
threshold <span class='k'>for</span> this <span class='k'>to</span> be <span class='o'>true</span> is not precisely defined by law<span class='o'>.</span>

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters<span class='o'>,</span> data
structure layouts <span class='k'>and</span> accessors<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> small macros <span class='k'>and</span> small inline
functions (ten lines <span class='k'>or</span> less <span class='k'>in</span> length)<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>then</span> the use <span class='k'>of</span> the object
file is unrestricted<span class='o'>,</span> regardless <span class='k'>of</span> whether it is legally a derivative
work<span class='o'>.</span>  (Executables containing this object code plus portions <span class='k'>of</span> the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>if</span> the work is a derivative <span class='k'>of</span> the Library<span class='o'>,</span> you may
distribute the object code <span class='k'>for</span> the work under the terms <span class='k'>of</span> Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6<span class='o'>,</span>
whether <span class='k'>or</span> not they are linked directly <span class='k'>with</span> the Library itself<span class='o'>.</span>

  6. As an <span class='k'>exception</span> <span class='k'>to</span> the Sections above<span class='o'>,</span> you may also compile <span class='k'>or</span>
link a <span class='s'>&#34;work that uses the Library&#34;</span> <span class='k'>with</span> the Library <span class='k'>to</span> produce a
work containing portions <span class='k'>of</span> the Library<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> distribute that work
under terms <span class='k'>of</span> your choice<span class='o'>,</span> provided that the terms permit
modification <span class='k'>of</span> the work <span class='k'>for</span> the customer's own use <span class='k'>and</span> reverse
engineering <span class='k'>for</span> debugging such modifications<span class='o'>.</span>

  You must give prominent notice <span class='k'>with</span> each copy <span class='k'>of</span> the work that the
Library is used <span class='k'>in</span> it <span class='k'>and</span> that the Library <span class='k'>and</span> its use are covered by
this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>  You must supply a copy <span class='k'>of</span> this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices<span class='o'>,</span> you must <span class='k'>include</span> the
copyright notice <span class='k'>for</span> the Library among them<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>as</span> well <span class='k'>as</span> a reference
directing the user <span class='k'>to</span> the copy <span class='k'>of</span> this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>  Also<span class='o'>,</span> you must <span class='k'>do</span> one
<span class='k'>of</span> these things<span class='o'>:</span>

    a) Accompany the work <span class='k'>with</span> the complete corresponding
    machine<span class='o'>-</span>readable source code <span class='k'>for</span> the Library including whatever
    changes were used <span class='k'>in</span> the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 <span class='k'>and</span> 2 above)<span class='o'>;</span> <span class='k'>and</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>if</span> the work is an executable linked
    <span class='k'>with</span> the Library<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>with</span> the complete machine<span class='o'>-</span>readable <span class='s'>&#34;work that
    uses the Library&#34;</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>as</span> object code <span class='k'>and</span><span class='o'>/</span><span class='k'>or</span> source code<span class='o'>,</span> so that the
    user can modify the Library <span class='k'>and</span> <span class='k'>then</span> relink <span class='k'>to</span> produce a modified
    executable containing the modified <span class='m'>Library</span><span class='o'>.</span>  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents <span class='k'>of</span> definitions files <span class='k'>in</span> the
    Library will not necessarily be able <span class='k'>to</span> recompile the application
    <span class='k'>to</span> use the modified definitions<span class='o'>.)</span>

    b) Accompany the work <span class='k'>with</span> a written offer<span class='o'>,</span> valid <span class='k'>for</span> at
    least three years<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>to</span> give the same user the materials
    specified <span class='k'>in</span> Subsection 6a<span class='o'>,</span> above<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>for</span> a charge no more
    than the cost <span class='k'>of</span> performing this distribution<span class='o'>.</span>

    c) If distribution <span class='k'>of</span> the work is made by offering access <span class='k'>to</span> copy
    from a designated place<span class='o'>,</span> offer equivalent access <span class='k'>to</span> copy the above
    specified materials from the same place<span class='o'>.</span>

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy <span class='k'>of</span> these
    materials <span class='k'>or</span> that you have already sent this user a copy<span class='o'>.</span>

  For an executable<span class='o'>,</span> the required form <span class='k'>of</span> the <span class='s'>&#34;work that uses the
Library&#34;</span> must <span class='k'>include</span> any data <span class='k'>and</span> utility programs needed <span class='k'>for</span>
reproducing the executable from it<span class='o'>.</span>  However<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>as</span> a special <span class='k'>exception</span><span class='o'>,</span>
the source code distributed need not <span class='k'>include</span> anything that is normally
distributed (<span class='k'>in</span> either source <span class='k'>or</span> binary form) <span class='k'>with</span> the major
components (compiler<span class='o'>,</span> kernel<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> so on) <span class='k'>of</span> the operating system on
which the executable runs<span class='o'>,</span> unless that component itself accompanies
the executable<span class='o'>.</span>

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions <span class='k'>of</span> other proprietary libraries that <span class='k'>do</span> not normally
accompany the operating system<span class='o'>.</span>  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them <span class='k'>and</span> the Library together <span class='k'>in</span> an executable that you
distribute<span class='o'>.</span>

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side<span class='o'>-</span>by<span class='o'>-</span>side <span class='k'>in</span> a single library together <span class='k'>with</span> other library
facilities not covered by this License<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> distribute such a combined
library<span class='o'>,</span> provided that the separate distribution <span class='k'>of</span> the work based on
the Library <span class='k'>and</span> <span class='k'>of</span> the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> provided that you <span class='k'>do</span> these two things<span class='o'>:</span>

    a) Accompany the combined library <span class='k'>with</span> a copy <span class='k'>of</span> the same work
    based on the Library<span class='o'>,</span> uncombined <span class='k'>with</span> any other library
    facilities<span class='o'>.</span>  This must be distributed under the terms <span class='k'>of</span> the
    Sections above<span class='o'>.</span>

    b) Give prominent notice <span class='k'>with</span> the combined library <span class='k'>of</span> the fact
    that part <span class='k'>of</span> it is a work based on the Library<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> explaining
    where <span class='k'>to</span> find the accompanying uncombined form <span class='k'>of</span> the same work<span class='o'>.</span>

  8. You may not copy<span class='o'>,</span> modify<span class='o'>,</span> sublicense<span class='o'>,</span> link <span class='k'>with</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>or</span> distribute
the Library except <span class='k'>as</span> expressly provided under this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>  Any
attempt otherwise <span class='k'>to</span> copy<span class='o'>,</span> modify<span class='o'>,</span> sublicense<span class='o'>,</span> link <span class='k'>with</span><span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>or</span>
distribute the Library is void<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> will automatically terminate your
rights under this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>  However<span class='o'>,</span> parties who have received copies<span class='o'>,</span>
<span class='k'>or</span> rights<span class='o'>,</span> from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long <span class='k'>as</span> such parties remain <span class='k'>in</span> full compliance<span class='o'>.</span>

  9. You are not required <span class='k'>to</span> accept this License<span class='o'>,</span> since you have not
signed it<span class='o'>.</span>  However<span class='o'>,</span> nothing <span class='k'>else</span> grants you permission <span class='k'>to</span> modify <span class='k'>or</span>
distribute the Library <span class='k'>or</span> its derivative works<span class='o'>.</span>  These actions are
prohibited by law <span class='k'>if</span> you <span class='k'>do</span> not accept this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>  Therefore<span class='o'>,</span> by
modifying <span class='k'>or</span> distributing the Library (<span class='k'>or</span> any work based on the
Library)<span class='o'>,</span> you indicate your acceptance <span class='k'>of</span> this License <span class='k'>to</span> <span class='k'>do</span> so<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span>
all its terms <span class='k'>and</span> conditions <span class='k'>for</span> copying<span class='o'>,</span> distributing <span class='k'>or</span> modifying
the Library <span class='k'>or</span> works based on it<span class='o'>.</span>

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (<span class='k'>or</span> any work based on the
Library)<span class='o'>,</span> the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor <span class='k'>to</span> copy<span class='o'>,</span> distribute<span class='o'>,</span> link <span class='k'>with</span> <span class='k'>or</span> modify the Library
subject <span class='k'>to</span> these terms <span class='k'>and</span> conditions<span class='o'>.</span>  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise <span class='k'>of</span> the rights granted herein<span class='o'>.</span>
You are not responsible <span class='k'>for</span> enforcing compliance by third parties <span class='k'>to</span>
this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>

  11. If<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>as</span> a consequence <span class='k'>of</span> a court judgment <span class='k'>or</span> allegation <span class='k'>of</span> patent
infringement <span class='k'>or</span> <span class='k'>for</span> any other reason (not limited <span class='k'>to</span> patent issues)<span class='o'>,</span>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order<span class='o'>,</span> agreement <span class='k'>or</span>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions <span class='k'>of</span> this License<span class='o'>,</span> they <span class='k'>do</span> not
excuse you from the conditions <span class='k'>of</span> this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>  If you cannot
distribute so <span class='k'>as</span> <span class='k'>to</span> satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License <span class='k'>and</span> any other pertinent obligations<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>then</span> <span class='k'>as</span> a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all<span class='o'>.</span>  For example<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>if</span> a patent
license would not permit royalty<span class='o'>-</span>free redistribution <span class='k'>of</span> the Library by
all those who receive copies directly <span class='k'>or</span> indirectly through you<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>then</span>
the only way you could satisfy both it <span class='k'>and</span> this License would be <span class='k'>to</span>
refrain entirely from distribution <span class='k'>of</span> the <span class='m'>Library</span><span class='o'>.</span>

If any portion <span class='k'>of</span> this section is held invalid <span class='k'>or</span> unenforceable under any
particular circumstance<span class='o'>,</span> the balance <span class='k'>of</span> the section is intended <span class='k'>to</span> apply<span class='o'>,</span>
<span class='k'>and</span> the section <span class='k'>as</span> a whole is intended <span class='k'>to</span> apply <span class='k'>in</span> other circumstances<span class='o'>.</span>

It is not the purpose <span class='k'>of</span> this section <span class='k'>to</span> induce you <span class='k'>to</span> infringe any
patents <span class='k'>or</span> other property right claims <span class='k'>or</span> <span class='k'>to</span> contest validity <span class='k'>of</span> any
such claims<span class='o'>;</span> this section has the sole purpose <span class='k'>of</span> protecting the
integrity <span class='k'>of</span> the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices<span class='o'>.</span>  Many people have made
generous contributions <span class='k'>to</span> the wide range <span class='k'>of</span> software distributed
through that system <span class='k'>in</span> reliance on consistent application <span class='k'>of</span> that
system<span class='o'>;</span> it is up <span class='k'>to</span> the author<span class='o'>/</span>donor <span class='k'>to</span> decide <span class='k'>if</span> he <span class='k'>or</span> she is willing
<span class='k'>to</span> distribute software through any other system <span class='k'>and</span> a licensee cannot
impose that choice<span class='o'>.</span>

This section is intended <span class='k'>to</span> make thoroughly clear what is believed <span class='k'>to</span>
be a consequence <span class='k'>of</span> the rest <span class='k'>of</span> this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>

  12. If the distribution <span class='k'>and</span><span class='o'>/</span><span class='k'>or</span> use <span class='k'>of</span> the Library is restricted <span class='k'>in</span>
certain countries either by patents <span class='k'>or</span> by copyrighted interfaces<span class='o'>,</span> the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries<span class='o'>,</span>
so that distribution is permitted only <span class='k'>in</span> <span class='k'>or</span> among countries not thus
excluded<span class='o'>.</span>  In such case<span class='o'>,</span> this License incorporates the limitation <span class='k'>as</span> <span class='k'>if</span>
written <span class='k'>in</span> the body <span class='k'>of</span> this <span class='m'>License</span><span class='o'>.</span>

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised <span class='k'>and</span><span class='o'>/</span><span class='k'>or</span> <span class='k'>new</span>
versions <span class='k'>of</span> the Library General Public License from time <span class='k'>to</span> time<span class='o'>.</span>
Such <span class='k'>new</span> versions will be similar <span class='k'>in</span> spirit <span class='k'>to</span> the present version<span class='o'>,</span>
but may differ <span class='k'>in</span> detail <span class='k'>to</span> address <span class='k'>new</span> problems <span class='k'>or</span> concerns<span class='o'>.</span>

Each version is given a distinguishing version number<span class='o'>.</span>  If the Library
specifies a version number <span class='k'>of</span> this License which applies <span class='k'>to</span> it <span class='k'>and</span>
<span class='s'>&#34;any later version&#34;</span><span class='o'>,</span> you have the option <span class='k'>of</span> following the terms <span class='k'>and</span>
conditions either <span class='k'>of</span> that version <span class='k'>or</span> <span class='k'>of</span> any later version published by
the Free Software <span class='m'>Foundation</span><span class='o'>.</span>  If the Library does not specify a
license version number<span class='o'>,</span> you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software <span class='m'>Foundation</span><span class='o'>.</span>

  14. If you wish <span class='k'>to</span> incorporate parts <span class='k'>of</span> the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible <span class='k'>with</span> these<span class='o'>,</span>
write <span class='k'>to</span> the author <span class='k'>to</span> ask <span class='k'>for</span> permission<span class='o'>.</span>  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation<span class='o'>,</span> write <span class='k'>to</span> the Free
Software Foundation<span class='o'>;</span> we sometimes make exceptions <span class='k'>for</span> this<span class='o'>.</span>  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals <span class='k'>of</span> preserving the free status
<span class='k'>of</span> all derivatives <span class='k'>of</span> our free software <span class='k'>and</span> <span class='k'>of</span> promoting the sharing
<span class='k'>and</span> reuse <span class='k'>of</span> software generally<span class='o'>.</span>

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE<span class='o'>,</span> THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY<span class='o'>,</span> TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE <span class='m'>LAW</span><span class='o'>.</span>

THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING<span class='o'>,</span> REPAIR OR <span class='m'>CORRECTION</span><span class='o'>.</span>

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER<span class='o'>,</span> OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND<span class='o'>/</span>OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE<span class='o'>,</span> BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES<span class='o'>,</span> INCLUDING ANY GENERAL<span class='o'>,</span> SPECIAL<span class='o'>,</span> INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING

FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE)<span class='o'>,</span> EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<span class='m'>DAMAGES</span><span class='o'>.</span>

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

     Appendix<span class='o'>:</span> How <span class='k'>to</span> Apply These Terms <span class='k'>to</span> Your New Libraries

  If you develop a <span class='k'>new</span> library<span class='o'>,</span> <span class='k'>and</span> you want it <span class='k'>to</span> be <span class='k'>of</span> the greatest
possible use <span class='k'>to</span> the public<span class='o'>,</span> we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute <span class='k'>and</span> change<span class='o'>.</span>  You can <span class='k'>do</span> so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (<span class='k'>or</span><span class='o'>,</span> alternatively<span class='o'>,</span> under the terms <span class='k'>of</span> the
ordinary General Public License)<span class='o'>.</span>

  To apply these terms<span class='o'>,</span> attach the following notices <span class='k'>to</span> the library<span class='o'>.</span>  It is
safest <span class='k'>to</span> attach them <span class='k'>to</span> the start <span class='k'>of</span> each source file <span class='k'>to</span> most effectively
convey the exclusion <span class='k'>of</span> warranty<span class='o'>;</span> <span class='k'>and</span> each file should have at least the
<span class='s'>&#34;copyright&#34;</span> line <span class='k'>and</span> a pointer <span class='k'>to</span> where the full notice is found<span class='o'>.</span>

    <span class='o'>&#60;</span>one line <span class='k'>to</span> give the library's name <span class='k'>and</span> a brief idea <span class='k'>of</span> what it does<span class='o'>.&#62;</span>

<a href="javascript:octry(' Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is\n numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any\nother libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for\nyour libraries, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if\nyou distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them\nwith the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright\nthe library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  Also, for each distributor&#39;s protection, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nlibrary.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original\nversion, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on\nthe original authors&#39; reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free\nsoftware will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect\ntransforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,\nwe have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s\nfree use or not licensed at all.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary\nGNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This\nlicense, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\ndesignated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary\none; be sure to read it in full, and don&#39;t assume that anything in it is\nthe same as in the ordinary license.\n\n  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that\nthey blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a\nprogram and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without\nchanging the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is\nanalogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in\na textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a\nderivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License\ntreats it as such.\n\n  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General\nPublic License for libraries did not effectively promote software\nsharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We\nconcluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.\n\n  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the\nusers of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the\nlibraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to\npermit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while\npreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free\nlibraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve\nthis as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards\nchanges in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this\nwill lead to faster development of free libraries.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n&#34;work based on the library&#34; and a &#34;work that uses the library&#34;.  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, while the latter only\nworks together with the library.\n\n  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary\nGeneral Public License rather than by this special one.\n\n                  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which\ncontains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized\nparty saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library\nGeneral Public License (also called &#34;this License&#34;).  Each licensee is\naddressed as &#34;you&#34;.\n\n  A &#34;library&#34; means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The &#34;Library&#34;, below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A &#34;work based on the\nLibrary&#34; means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term &#34;modification&#34;.)\n\n  &#34;Source code&#34; for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a &#34;work that uses the Library&#34;.  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a &#34;work that uses the Library&#34; with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a &#34;work that uses the\nlibrary&#34;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a &#34;work that uses the Library&#34; uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or\nlink a &#34;work that uses the Library&#34; with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &#34;work that\n    uses the Library&#34;, as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the &#34;work that uses the\nLibrary&#34; must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe source code distributed need not include anything that is normally\ndistributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Library General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n&#34;any later version&#34;, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &#34;AS IS&#34; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n&#34;copyright&#34; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    &#60;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&#62;\n    Copyright (C) &#60;year&#62;  &#60;name of author&#62;\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Library General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free\n    Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston,\n    MA 02111-1307, USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a &#34;copyright disclaimer&#34; for the library, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob&#39; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\n\n  &#60;signature of Ty Coon&#62;, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat&#39;s all there is to it!\n\n');">[try]</a></code></pre>
