<p>Nice, isn’t it? Our question was: if we can so beautifully go from typed syntax (expressions) to typed semantics (OCaml values), can we do the converse, i.e., go from an OCaml value back to a (normal) expression of the same type? In other words, can we implement NbE in a typeful manner, using GADTs?</p>
<p>The answer is a proud “yes”, but more interestingly, we all learned some interesting GADT techniques and puzzling logical interpretations on the way. Read on to know more!</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://cs.au.dk/~mpuech/typeful.pdf"><strong>Tagless and Typeful Normalization by Evaluation using Generalized Algebraic Data Types</strong></a></p>
<p>We present the first tagless and typeful implementation of normalization by evaluation for the simply typed λ-calculus in OCaml, using Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADTs). In contrast to normalization by reduction, which is operationally carried out by repeated instances of one-step reduction, normalization by evaluation uses a non-standard model to internalize intermediate results: it is defined by composing a non-standard evaluation function with a reification function that maps the denotation of a term into the normal form of this term. So far, normalization by evaluation has been implemented either in dependently-typed languages such as Coq or Agda, or in general-purpose languages such as Scheme, ML or Haskell. In the latter case, denotations are either tagged or Church-encoded. Tagging means injecting denotations, either implicitly or explicitly, into a universal domain of values; Church encoding is based on the impredicativity of the metalanguage. Here, we show how to obtain not only tagless values, making evaluation efficient, but also typeful reification, guaranteeing type preservation and η-long, β-normal forms. To this end, we put OCaml’s GADTs to work. Furthermore, our implementation does not depend on any particular representation of binders (HOAS, de Bruijn levels or indices) nor on the style (direct style, continuation-passing style, etc.) of the non-standard evaluation function.</p></blockquote>

<p>Last Thursday a bunch of us from the OCaml Labs team gave an OCaml tutorial at the <a href="http://fpdays.net/2013/sessions/index.php?session=24">FPDays</a> conference (an event for people interested in Functional Programming). <a href="https://github.com/yallop">Jeremy</a> and I led the session with <a href="http://www.lpw25.net">Leo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dsheets">David</a> and <a href="http://philippewang.info/CL/">Philippe</a> helping everyone progress and dealing with questions.</p>
<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/images/fpdays2013/fpdays2013-01.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"></img>
<p>It turned out to be by far the <em>most popular session</em> at the conference with over 20 people all wanting to get to grips with OCaml! An excellent turnout and a great indicator of the interest that’s out there, especially when you offer a hands-on session to people. This shouldn’t be a surprise as we’ve had good attendance for the general <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-NonDysFunctional-Programmers/">OCaml meetups</a> I’ve run and also the <a href="http://ocamllabs.github.io/compiler-hacking/2013/09/17/compiler-hacking-july-2013.html">compiler hacking sessions</a>, which Jeremy and Leo have been building up (do sign up if you’re interested in either of those!). We had a nice surprise for attendees, which were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_proof">uncorrected proof</a> copies of Real World OCaml and luckily, we had just enough to go around.</p>

<p>For the tutorial itself, Jeremy put together a nice sequence of exercises and a <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/fpdays-skeleton">skeleton repo</a> (with helpful comments in the code) so that people could dive in quickly. The event was set up to be really informal and the rough plan was as following:</p>

<p>For the tutorial itself, Jeremy put together a nice sequence of exercises and a <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/fpdays-skeleton">skeleton repo</a> (with helpful comments in the code) so that people could dive in quickly. The event was set up to be really informal and the rough plan was as following:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Installation/Intro</em> - We checked that people had been able to follow the <a href="http://amirchaudhry.com/fpdays-ocaml-session/">installation instructions</a>, which we’d sent them in advance. We also handed out copies of the book and made sure folks were comfortable with <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org">OPAM</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Hello world</em> - A light intro to get people familiar with the OCaml syntax and installing packages with OPAM. This would also help people to get familiar with the toolchain, workflow and compilation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Monty Hall browser game</em> - Using <a href="http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/"><code>js_of_ocaml</code></a>, we wanted people to create and run the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> in their browser. This would give people a taste of some real world interaction by having to deal with the DOM and interfaces. If folks did well, they could add code to keep logs of the game results.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Client-server game</em> - The previous game was all in the browser (so could be examined by players) so here the task was to split it into a client and server, ensuring the two stay in sync. This would demonstrate the re-usability of the OCaml code already written and give people a feel for client server interactions. If people wanted to do more, they could use <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/pkg/ctypes/0.1.1/">ctypes</a> and get better random numbers.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>We did manage to stick to the overall scheme as above and we think this is a great base from which to improve future tutorials. It has the really nice benefit of having visual, interactive elements and the ability to run things both in the browser as well as on the server is a great way to show the versatility of OCaml. <code>js_of_ocaml</code> is quite a mature tool and so it’s no surprise that it’s also used by companies such as Facebook (see the recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKWNjFagR9k">CUFP talk by Julien Verlaguet</a> - skip to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=gKWNjFagR9k#t=1149">19:00</a>).</p>

<p>We learned a lot from running this session so we’ve captured the good, the bad and the ugly below. This is useful for anyone who’d like to run an OCaml tutorial in the future and also for us to be aware of the next time we do this. I’ve incorporated the feedback from the attendees as well as our own thoughts.</p>

<h3 id="things_we_learnt">Things we learnt</h3>

<h4 id="the_good">The Good</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Most people really did follow the install instructions beforehand. This made things so much easier on the day as we didn’t have to worry about compile times and people getting bored. A few people had even got in touch with me the night before to sort out installation problems.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Many folks from OCaml Labs also came over to help people, which meant no-one was waiting longer than around 10 seconds before getting help.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We had a good plan of the things we wanted to cover but we were happy to be flexible and made it clear the aim was to get right into it. Several folks told us that they really appreciated this loose (as opposed to rigid) structure.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We didn’t spend any time lecturing the room but instead got people right into the code. Having enough of a skeleton to get something interesting working was a big plus in this regard. People did progress from the early examples to the later ones fairly well.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We had a VM with the correct set up that we could log people into if they were having trouble locally. Two people made use of this.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Of course, It was great to have early proofs of the book and these were well-received.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/images/fpdays2013/fpdays2013-02.jpg" alt="RWO books galore!"></img></p>

<h4 id="the_bad">The Bad</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In our excitement to get right into the exercises, we didn’t really give an overview of OCaml and its benefits. A few minutes at the beginning would be enough and it’s important so that people can leave with a few sound-bites.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Not everyone received my email about installation, and certainly not the late arrivals. This meant some pain getting things downloaded and running especially due to the wifi (see ‘Ugly’ below).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A few of the people who <em>had</em> installed, didn’t complete the instructions fully but didn’t realise this until the morning of the session. There was a good suggestion about having some kind of test to run that would check everything, so you’d know if there was something missing.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We really should have had a cut-off where we told people to use VMs instead of fixing installation issues and 10-15 minutes would have been enough. This would have been especially useful for the late-comers.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>We didn’t really keep a record of the problems folks were having so we can’t now go back and fix underlying issues. To be fair, this would have been a little awkward to do ad-hoc but in hindsight, it’s a good thing to plan for.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the_ugly">The Ugly</h4>

<ul>
<li>The only ugly part was the wifi. It turned out that the room itself was a bit of a dead-spot and that wasn’t helped by 30ish devices trying to connect to one access point! Having everyone grab packages at the same time in the morning probably didn’t help. It was especially tricky as all our mitigation plans seemed to revolve around at least having local connectivity. In any case, this problem only lasted for the morning session and was a little better by the afternoon. I’d definitely recommend a backup plan in the case of complete wifi failure next time! One such plan that Leo got started on was to put the repository and other information onto a flash drive that could be shared with people. We didn’t need this in the end but it’ll be useful to have something like this prepared for next time. If anyone fancies donating a bunch of flash drives, I’ll happily receive them!</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, it was a great session and everyone left happy, having completed most of the tutorial (and with a book!). A few even continued at home afterwards and <a href="https://twitter.com/richardclegg/status/393458073052139520">got in touch</a> to let us know that they got everything working. It was a great session and thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkDalgarno">Mark</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JacquiDDavidson">Jacqui</a> and the rest of the FPDays crew for a great conference!</p>

Below are some prep instructions for attendees.</p>

<h3 id="preparation_for_the_session">Preparation for the session</h3>

<p>If you’re starting from scratch, installation can take some time so it’s best to get as much done in advance as possible. You’ll need OPAM (the package manager), OCaml 4.01 (available through OPAM) and a few libraries before Thursday. If you have any issues, please contact Amir.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>OPAM</strong>: Follow the instructions for your platform at <a href="http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Quick_Install.html">http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Quick_Install.html</a>. OPAM requires OCaml so hopefully the relevant dependencies will kick in and you’ll get OCaml too (most likely version 3.12). You can get a cup of coffee while you wait. After installation, run <code>opam init</code> to initialise OPAM.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>OCaml 4.01</strong>: We actually need the latest version of OCaml but OPAM makes this easy. Just run the following (and get more coffee):</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>opam update
<span class="nv">$ </span>opam switch 4.01.0
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">eval</span> <span class="sb">`</span>opam config env<span class="sb">`</span>

<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">eval</span> <span class="sb">`</span>opam config env<span class="sb">`</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Libraries</strong>: For the workshop you will need to check that you have the following installed: <code>libffi</code>, <code>pcre</code> and <code>pkg-config</code>. This will depend on your platform so on a Mac with homebrew I would do <code>brew install libffi pcre pkg-config</code> or on Debian or Ubuntu <code>apt-get install libffi-dev</code>. After this, two OCaml packages it’s worth installing in advance are <code>core</code> and <code>js_of_ocaml</code> so simply run:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>opam install core js_of_ocaml
</code></pre></div>
<p>OPAM will take care of the dependencies and the rest we can get on the day!</p><a onclick="switchContent('post6','post5')" class="btn" href="#302361c5802eabeca4d0ab44c3b05b76">Hide</a></div></span>

It was originally designed and tuned to prove formulas generated by the <a href="http://why.lri.fr">Why tool</a>. Now, it is used by different tools and in various contexts, in particular via the <a href="http://why3.lri.fr">Why3 platform</a>. As shown by the diagram below, Alt-Ergo is used to prove formulas:</p><ul> <li> <p>generated from Ada code by SPARK 2005 and <a href="http://www.spark-2014.org">SPARK 2014</a>,</p> </li><li> <p>generated from C programs by <a href="http://frama-c.com">Frama-C</a> and <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1028953&amp;tag=1">CAVEAT</a>,</p> </li><li> <p>produced from WhyML programs by <a href="http://why3.lri.fr">Why3</a>,</p> </li><li> <p>translated from proof obligations generated by <a href="http://www.atelierb.eu">Atelier-B</a>,</p> </li> </ul><p>Moreover, Alt-Ergo is used in the context of cryptographic protocols verification by <a href="http://www.easycrypt.info">EasyCrypt</a> and in SMT-based model checking by <a href="http://cubicle.lri.fr">Cubicle</a>.</p><p><a href="http://www.ocamlpro.com/feed/![ae_spider.png](/files/ae_spider.png)"><img src="http://www.ocamlpro.com//files/ae_spider.png" alt="ae_spider.png"></img></a></p><h2> Some "Hello World" Examples</h2><p>Below are some basic formulas written in the why input syntax. Each example is proved valid by Alt-Ergo. The first formulas is very simple and is proved with a straightforward arithmetic reasoning. <code>"goal g2"</code> requires reasoning in the combination of functional arrays and linear arithmetic, etc. The last example contains a quantified sub-formula with a polymorphic variable <code>x</code>. Generating four ground instances of this axiom where <code>x</code> is replaced by <code>1</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>1.4</code> and <code>a</code> respectively is necessary to prove <code>"goal g5"</code>.</p><pre><code>(*** Simple arithmetic formula ***)
goal g1 : 1 + 2  = 3

(*** Theories of functional arrays and linear integer arithemtic ***)
logic a : (int, int) farray
goal g2 : forall i:int. i = 6 -&gt; a[i&lt;-4][5] = a[i-1]

(*** Theories of records and linear integer arithmetic ***)
type my_record = { a : int ; b : int }
goal g3 : forall v,w : my_record. 2 * v.a = 10 -&gt; { v with b = 5} = w -&gt; w.a = 5

(*** theories of enumerated data types and uninterpreted equality ***)
type my_sum = A | B | C
logic P : 'a -&gt; prop
goal g4 : forall x : my_sum. P(C) -&gt; x&lt;&gt;A and x&lt;&gt;B -&gt; P(x)

</code></pre><h2> Alt-Ergo @ OCamlPro</h2><p>On September 20, we officially announced the distribution and the support of Alt-Ergo by OCamlPro and launched its <a href="http://alt-ergo.ocamlpro.com">new website</a>. This site allows to download public releases of the prover and to discover available support offerings. It'll be enriched with additional content progressively. The former Alt-Ergo's web page hosted by LRI is now devoted to theoretical foundations and academic aspects of the solver.</p><p>We have also published a new public release (version 0.95.2) of Alt-Ergo. The main changes in this minor release are: source code reorganization into sub-directories, simplification of quantifiers instantiation heuristics, GUI improvement to reduce latency when opening large files, as well as various bug fixes.</p><p>In addition to the re-implementation and the simplification of some parts of the prover (e.g. internal literals representation, theories combination architecture, ...), the main novelties of the current master branch of Alt-Ergo are the following:</p><ul> <li> <p>The user can now specify an external (plug-in) SAT-solver instead of the default DFS-based engine. We experimentally provide a CDCL solver based on miniSAT that can be plugged to perform satisfiability reasoning. This solver is more efficient when formulas contain a rich propositional structure.</p> </li><li> <p>We started the development of a new tool, called Ctrl-Alt-Ergo, in which we put our expertise by implementing the most interesting strategies of Alt-Ergo. The experiments we made with our internal benchmarks are very promising, as shown below.</p> </li> </ul><h2> Experimental Evaluation</h2><p>We compared the performances of latest public releases of Alt-Ergo with the current master branch of both Alt-Ergo and Ctrl-Alt-Ergo (commit <code>ce0bba61a1fd234b85715ea2c96078121c913602</code>) on our internal test suite composed of 16209 formulas. Timeout was set to 60 seconds and memory was limited to 2GB per formula. Benchmarks descriptions and the results of our evaluation are given below.</p><h3>Why3 Benchmark</h3><p>This benchmark contains 2470 formulas generated from Why3's gallery of WhyML programs. Some of these formulas are out of scope of current SMT solvers. For instance, the proof of some of them requires inductive reasoning.</p><h3>SPARK Hi-lite Benchmark</h3><p>This benchmark is composed of 3167 formulas generated from Ada programs used during Hi-lite project. It is known that some formulas are not valid.</p><h3> BWare Benchmark</h3><p>This test-suite contains 10572 formulas translated from proof obligations generated by Atelier-B. These proof obligations are issued from industrial B projects and are proved valid.</p><p></p><p></p><table style="font-size: 90%; width: 100%;" class="tableau2">

<p>I’ve just uploaded the camera-ready of our <a href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2013/">HotNets 2013</a> paper, titled <em>”<a href="http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2013-hotnets-trevi.pdf">Trevi: Watering Down Storage Hotspots with Cool Fountain Codes</a>”</em>. This is my first foray into fountain coding, and it’s really exciting working with <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~gp349/">George Parisis</a> (who has done lots of cool work in this field) to apply it as the backend storage to upcoming projects.</p>

<p>For instance, I’m working with <a href="http://gazagnaire.org">Thomas Gazagnaire</a> on a branch-consistent database called <a href="https://github.com/samoht/irminsule">Irminsule</a>, which aims to support very scalable git-style persistent programming.

<p>Here’s the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Datacenter networking has brought high-performance storage systems research to the foreground once again. Many modern storage systems are built with commodity hardware and TCP/IP networking to save costs. We highlight a group of problems that are present in such storage systems and which are all related to the use of TCP. As an alternative, we explore Trevi: a fountain coding-based approach for distributing I/O requests that overcomes these problems while still efficiently scheduling resources across both networking and storage layers. We also discuss how receiver-driven flow and congestion control, in combination with fountain coding, can guide the design of Trevi and provide a viable alternative to TCP for datacenter storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The attraction of our fountain coding scheme is its simplicity when compared to dealing with TCP-based retrieval, particularly for larger k/v stores where multiple nodes can respond without any strong synchronization. Comments on the paper are most welcome ahead of HotNets!</p>
