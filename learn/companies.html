<p><a href='http://runorg.com'>RunOrg</a>, France.</p>
<p>RunOrg provides non-profits and organizations with a private intranet
and public website using a SaaS model. The application is written
entirely in OCaml for two reasons : one is performance, as OCaml
generates fast binaries and supports elegant optimization patterns.<br />
 The other reason is that the flexible and powerful compile-time type
inference allows massive changes in the code base without causing any
bugs, effectively acting as a compiler-generated unit testing suite.<br />
 The software is powered by an open source in-house web framework,

<p><a href='http://www.seaiq.com/'>Sakhalin, LLC</a>, United States.</p>

boaters to professional river/harbor pilots that board large freighters.
They are free to download and try (with a paid upgrade to enable all
features). They are written almost entirely in Ocaml with a minor amount
of glue to interface with IOS API&#39;s. Ocaml was chosen because it (1)
enables the rapid development of extremely reliable and high performance
software, (2) is a mature stable platform, and (3) has a wide range of
libraries. It was made possible by the great work done by Psellos in
porting Ocaml to the Apple IOS platform. Feel free to contact Sakhalin
if you have any questions about using Ocaml on IOS.</p>
